        "## Markov chains\n",
        "The best way to introduce what a Markov chain is with a simple example. Suppose you have a simple counter that you can set to any number between 0 and 9 (including 0 and 9). At every step you roll a standard 6 -sided die and depending on whether the rolled number is even or odd you either increment or decrement the counter. If you try to increment at 9, lets say it wraps around to 0 and similarly for trying to decrement at 0. Now you can play this game for multiple steps and record the counter value after every step, this is just a simple markov chain.\n",

        "Here is an example evolution of the markov chain,\n",
        "Start with counter at 1.\n",
        "- Step 1 : Roll a 4, its even so increment the counter to 2.\n",
        "- Step 2 : Roll a 2, its even so increment the counter to 3.\n",
        "- Step 3 : Roll a 5, its odd so decrement the counter to 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "A markov chain consists of a set of n states (in our example it was the 10 states of the counter) and a probabilistic rule to jump to another state every step (the dice rolls). Although in our simple example we had a similar rule for each state, you can have a different rule for each state. For example you may say that if you the counter is odd, dont roll a die, always increment, and follow the die for even states. The rule is always in the form of n probabilities that sum to one. Each probability indicates the chance that it jumps to that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our example the rule for state 0 can be represented by the below numpy vector\n",
